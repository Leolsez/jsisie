A .NET parser for SIE files that can read files of version 1 to 4 (including 4i)

Follow [this link](https://sie.se/vadsie/) for swedish versions and [this link](https://sie.se/in-english/) for english versions of the SIE specifications.

If your company want to fund the developer please [create an invoice](https://invoice.jsisoft.se) for you finance department.

**Read a SIE file**

To read a file create an instance of SieDocument and call ReadDocument.

There are some properties on SieDocument that changes how the parsing works:

+ AllowUnbalancedVoucher: If true the parser will allow vouchers that do not sum to zero.
+ IgnoreMissingOMFATTNING: If true the parser will not flag a missing #OMFATTN as an error.
+ IgnoreBTRANS: If true #BTRANS (removed voucher rows) will be ignored.
+ IgnoreRTRANS: If true #RTRANS (added voucher rows) will be ignored.
+ AllowMissingDate: If true some errors for missing dates will be ignored. (same as IgnoreMissingDate)
+ StreamValues: If true don't store values internally. The user has to use the Callback class to get the values. Usefull for large files.
+ ThrowErrors: If false then cache all Exceptions in SieDocument.ValidationExceptions
+ DateFormat: The standard says yyyyMMdd and parser will default to that, but you can change the format to whatever you want.
+ Encoding: The standard says codepage 437, but you can change it to whatever you want. The default will fallback to 28591 (ISO-8859-1) if 437 is not available. Please note that #KSUMMA will not be caclutated if you choose a multibyte encoding.
+ AllowUnderDimensions: Enables reading #UNDERDIM, default is false to prevent breaking existing usage.

**Write a SIE file**

To write a file create an instance of SieDocumentWriter and call WriteDocument
The WriteOptions class contains properties to set DateFormat and Encoding.

**Compare SIE files**

To compare SIE files call the static method Compare on SieDocumentComparer. It will return a List&lt;string&gt; with differences between the files.  


Even if you use this parser you should get familiar with the file specification.
I have not made any extensive efforts to validate the resulting data against the files so please do your validation and tell me if you find any errors.
